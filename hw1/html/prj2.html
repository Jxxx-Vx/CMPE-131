          The MouseTrap Car was one of the very first projects that I have ever taken.
          The project was part of a competition offered by the Mathmathecal,
          Engineering, Scientific and Achievements program, also known as MESA.
          The goal of this project was to design and create an optimal mouse
          trap apparatus that would allow the mouse trap to travel the furthest
          distance up a 30 degree slope ramp using only the force provided by
          the mouse trap.

          Working on this project with one other partner, I carried through with
          the design and testing process over the course of a few months, which resulted
          in our project placing first at the local competition out of a dozen schools,
          and third at the MESA Regionals competition.
