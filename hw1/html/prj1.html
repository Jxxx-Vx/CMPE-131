            The Vex Robot project was a 6 weeks long class project for ENGR 10
            that involved programming and designing a VEX robot to initiate
            a series of tasks. The series of tasks was to allow the robot to navigate
            a boxed room and locate two beacons, in which the robot would deactivate
            the first beacon using a claw that we designed, as well as push the second
            beacon outside of the room. The objective of this project was to complete the
            series tasks in the least amount of time.

            As one of the main programmers in my group,
            I was a key member in the coding and debugging process,
            and lead my group to sucess as we were able to accomplish the tasks
            with one of the lowest times.
